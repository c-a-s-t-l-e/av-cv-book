    "text": "Preface\nThis book’s goal is to help you think about autonomous and connected vehicles (AVs and CVs).\nThis will hopefully help you answer the questions:\n\nhow can I implement a cv/av system in the real world legally?\nhow can I talk to others about the cv/av system?\nhow can I build a cv/av system (virtually and/or physically)?\n\nTo assist you in that effort the book has been divided into roughly three parts:\n\nbureaucracy -&gt; to navigate the regulatory landscape\nterminology -&gt; to help you know what’s what\ntechnology -&gt; to help you build what you want\n\nJust like lots of things in the tech space though, this book is definitely not perfect and should always be considered a work in progress. Feel free to reach out to me if you think something could be improved or would be a good addition to the text.\nAs always though, press on!",
