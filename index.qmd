# Preface {#sec-preface .unnumbered}

This book's goal is to help you think about autonomous and connected vehicles (AVs and CVs).

This will hopefully help you answer the questions:

- how can I implement a cv/av system in the real world legally?
- how can I talk to others about the cv/av system?
- how can I build a cv/av system (virtually and/or physically)?

To assist you in that effort the book has been divided into roughly three parts:

- bureaucracy -> to navigate the regulatory landscape
- terminology -> to help you know what's what
- technology -> to help you build what you want

Just like lots of things in the tech space though, this book is definitely not perfect and should always be considered a work in progress. Feel free to reach out to me if you think something could be improved or would be a good addition to the text.

As always though, press on!
