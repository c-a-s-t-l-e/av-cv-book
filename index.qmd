# Preface {.unnumbered}

This book's goal is to give you an overview of the world of transportation.

This will hopefully give you the know-how to generally understand:

- the bureaucratic structures, 
- domain-specific terminology, and 
- technological steps 

requisite to becoming useful in this domain.

Just like lots of things in transportation, this book is definitely not perfect and should always be considered a work in progress. Feel free to reach out to me if you think something could be improved or would be a good addition to the text.

As always though, press on!
