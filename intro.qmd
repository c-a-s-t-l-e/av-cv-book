# Introduction {#sec-intro .unnumbered}

There's always the great temptation to read and book and feel like you've done something.

This book's goal is not that. It's to help you get stuff done. 

Specifically, this book's goal is to help you know where you and where you want to go in the world of transportation.

The main focus will be on working with and implementing transportation technology.
